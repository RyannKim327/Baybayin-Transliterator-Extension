### Introduction
> Baybayin is a Philippine script. The script is an abugida belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. Geographically, it was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being replaced by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It is very different to the alibata (alif-bata), which some scholars known. Under House Bill 1022 or the proposed "National Writing System Act" is authored by Rep. Leopoldo Bataoil. The measure seeks to declare **Baybayin** as the Philippines’ national writing system, generating greater awareness on the plight of Baybayin and foster wider appreciation on its importance and beauty.

### Inspiration and history in Development
> I created some baybayin related projects such as ***Sulat Baybayin*** an android application with web based chatting platform (2020-2021). I've also created a rest api of baybayin transliterator(2021). I've also developed a baybayin npm package(2022), and recently, I've made an update of ***biblegateway-scrape*** where it sends a transliterated version of bible verses into baybayin. Big thanks to someone who requested to us to create a simple android application where we can see some baybayin characters.
